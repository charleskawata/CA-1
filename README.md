This is a introductory assignment for machine learning. The goal of this assignment is to help in my understanding of the basic steps of machine learning specifically with the data understanding, pre-processing, and post processing. The data set that we were given was about house prices and the different factors that could be used to predict a house price. 

Import the data using this link and read it in as a CSV: 'https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA01/house-price-train.csv'

After you import the data break the problem up into 3 steps: Data Understanding, Data Pre Processing, and Data Post Processing. It is immportant that in data understanding you get an idea about the numerical / categorical variables as well as the presence of outleirs using box plots. Use any other visualizations (bar chart, line chart, box plots) to get a better understanding of variables and what issues need to be addressed in the pre-processing stage. Additionally, it is important to establish the data report that details which columns of the data have issues such as null or missing values. 

In the pre-processing stage, it is important to remove outliers, address missing / NA values, drop duplicates, and fill in any variables that are missing. 

Lastly, we wwant to do feature selection by creating a heat map to see the correlation between sales price and the different variables. We want variables with high correlation and no multi collinearity. Once we have chosen these vairables we also want to encode any categorical variables into dummy variables so that the model can interpret categorical data.
